Windows-IOT-Just-a-simple-LED

This program turns on GPIO Pin 4 and powers up an LED.

All you need to do is to plug an LED into GPIO Pin 4 and the 3.3V.

I am learning to program a Windows IOT device using Visual Studio. There are tons of complex samples, but I got really conused as to what was going on.
I am not a computer programmer and have no idea about classes and other stuff. 

These simple programs are there for me to understand what is going on before moving onto more difficult ideas.
